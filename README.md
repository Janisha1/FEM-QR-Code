## My process
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first design

### What I learned
I learnt that it is good practise to reset the CSS because of browser pre-set values.  

### Continued development
Would like to use sass or scss for styling in future.

### Useful resources
- [Reset CSS](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - This was great at explaining the reset css code
